/*
  To create an API using C#, you will need to perform the following steps:

  Choose a framework for building your API. Some popular frameworks for building APIs in C# include ASP.NET Core and NancyFX.

  Define the endpoints (URLs) and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for your API. Each endpoint should correspond to a specific function or set of functions in your API.

  Implement the API endpoints by writing C# code that performs the desired functionality. You can use the framework's routing mechanisms to map the endpoints to your C# code.

  Test your API to ensure that it is working as expected. You can use a tool like Postman to make HTTP requests to your API and verify the responses.

  Here is an example of a simple API implemented using ASP.NET Core:
*/

using System;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace MyAPI.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class HelloWorldController : ControllerBase
    {
        [HttpGet]
        public string Get()
        {
            return "Hello, World!";
        }
    }
}
